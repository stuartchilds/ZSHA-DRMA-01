DRMA is a two motor drawing machine inspired by many other machines of this design. I saw Matthew Venn messing around with a version of this and wanted to make one based on oomlout's OOBB design principle ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout-OOBB )

I put time into this design so that I could run workshops for people - learning to solder the circuit board before getting to play with the machine and make some nice drawings.

Circuit board was designed by Matt Venn - find it here https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/GKjx5Y9X

Functionality
Circuit board allows for speed and direction control of 2x DC motors. Each motor intended to drive arms that can be linked in many ways creating pivots and levers moving on a large drawing surface.
Machine designed to hold pens and an A4 sheet of paper to create patterns. Physical output designed to stimulate experimentation and creativity.

Brief assembly notes

- solder components to circuit board
- cut one end off each jumper wire
- solder 9v battery clip or power source leads to circuit board
- solder 4x jumper wires to M1+,M1-,M2+,M2- terminals on circuit board
- solder 2x jumper wires to each motor
- use plastic rivets and spacers (or screws and nuts) to mount circuit board to OOBB mounting plate
- use self tapping screws (2 per motor) to attach motors to OOBB mounting plates
- choose position of circuit board and motor mounting plates onto drawing board and use 2x M6 12mm bolts and M6 nuts to attach each plate to main drawing board
- attach 1x countersunk screw and M6 connecting nut to 2 OOBB circles
- press one OOBB circle with screw and nut onto each motor drive spindle
- use 2x long header pins to connect each motor to circuit board and test that board works. 
- attach long OOBB arms to motor circles using M6 30mm bolts - finger tight to stop bolts working loose
- add more OOBB arms as desired - including pivot points and overlapping parts. Avoid triangles that prevent free movement of arms. Use M6 12mm bolts with M6 nylock nuts to allow for quick assembly of pivot points that don't work loose.
- build pen holder
- attach pen
- attach paper to drawing board
- experiment and draw!
